Introduction:

The application is basicly a platform for varieties of tools. I have created 3 categories in which the tools are being 
filtered such as: Machining Tools, Hand Tools and Protective/Personal equipment. Every user doesn't matter if he has 
account or no has access to the catalogs themselves, but only the logged users can see the details and profile page. 
If you are an admin you can create, edit and delete tools. The application is really simple and shows what I have 
learned during my Angular course. Since I'm currenlty expanding the application I have non-functioning parts in it.
